Project Overview
GC Content Calculation:
Determines the percentage of guanine (G) and cytosine (C) bases in a DNA sequence.
DNA to RNA Transcription:
Converts a DNA sequence to an RNA sequence by replacing thymine (T) with uracil (U).
Open Reading Frame (ORF) Finder:
Identifies ORFs, with a configurable minimum length, that starts with ATG and ends with a stop codon (TAA, TAG, TGA).
